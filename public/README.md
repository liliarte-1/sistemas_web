Portfolio Website

A personal developer portfolio showcasing projects, experience, and contact information.
Built with HTML, CSS (Grid & Flexbox), and custom Inter fonts, this website is designed for clean structure, responsive layout, and modern aesthetics.

Features:
- Responsive Design – Built entirely with CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile.
- Custom Typography – Uses locally hosted Inter font family (assets/fonts) for consistent rendering.
- Reusable Components – Clear, modular CSS with section-specific grid layouts.
- Clipboard Integration – Quick copy-to-clipboard functionality for contact info.
- Lucide Icons – Lightweight icon system via Lucide

Also:
- In the styles.css is an explanation of properties used, to understand better the style of the web. The comments are in Spanish because I am a Spanish developer and I need to understand them if I come back to see my previous work. To translate them to English, just copy and paste them in ChatGPT or the classic traducer.
- I implemented a simple script to copy and paste the email and phone number.

Firebase Hosting – Deployed using Firebase for fast global delivery and SSL support.

GitHub Integration – Version-controlled and published through GitHub Pages or Actions.
